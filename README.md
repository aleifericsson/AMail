# AMail
An email application made using python's pygame library, which doesn't connect to the internet but is a proof of concept of object orientation to make functional UI.

To run the application, make sure you have python installed and run AMail.py. (The resized version has UI with double the size of the original version in case it renders too small on your device.)
